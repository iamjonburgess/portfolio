# Diamonds Data Science Project

This Project takes data from a .csv file (source: https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds) and 
produces different charts to visualize data about diamonds in the dataset.

The different graphs include:

- clarity vs carat size 
- number of diamonds in each clarity type
- number of diamonds in each color type 
- and a heat plot to find correlations.
