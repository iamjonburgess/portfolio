Note: In order to run this project, authentication credentials are needed from Google.
This can be obtained from signing up to cloud.google.com (Google offers a free trial for
this) and downloading the credentials as a .json file. The location for the authentication 
file placement will be noted in each program as 'INSERT .JSON CREDENTIAL FILENAME'.
