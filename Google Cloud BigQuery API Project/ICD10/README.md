# ICD Codes Project

For this project we would like to look for patients with "bone diseases and arthropathies
without major complication or comorbidity." This is MS_DRG code 554. This is done through
one of the most complex coding systems in the world, called ICD-10, which maps virtually
any diagnostic condition to a single code.

We are going to search the entire inpatient_charges_2015 dataset looking for the 
MS_DRG code 554, which is "Bone Diseases And Arthropathies Without Major Complication Or
Comorbidity," or, in other words, people who have issues with their bones, but with no
serious issues currently manifesting externally.

## ICD Codes

ICD10 is the well-established method for coding medical professional diagnoses for
billing and analysis purposes. The latest version of ICD-10 was finally made mandatory in
2015 with great angst throughout the medical community. It consists of, at its largest
expanse, over 155,000 codes, from M79.603 - Pain in Arm, unspecified to S92.4 - Fracture
of Greater Toe. These codes are somewhat merged into the MS_DRG codes that are used in
the Medicare databases we examine here as they are used for hospital admissions.
